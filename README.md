### Topic: Circuits in Quantum Algorithms

Notebook: https://github.com/Cryoris/notebooks/...
Documentation: http://qisk.it/circuits

The power of quantum algorithms is rooted in the circuits they run. In this circuit session we'll give an overview on which circuits are used in algorithms and how both are interacting in Qiskit. There, the circuit library provides a collection of problem-specific circuits that can be used in different algorithms, but it also contains generic building blocks to create these algorithms.
